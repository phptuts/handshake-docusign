# Hand Shake

Use ws and a web server to communicate with esp 32 directly.  Then it can talk to the server.  We were able to get the webhooks working.  

ESP will send the user id and account id to web socket server so that it know what to send to what. 

These are big guids so it should not get mixed up.
